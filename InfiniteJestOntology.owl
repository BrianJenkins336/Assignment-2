Once James Incandenza (See Above) dies, Charles becomes the Headmaster of Enfield Tennis Academy. He often ponders whether James’s sons like him for replacing their father at the academy, and Charles is so weirded out by the physical appearance of Mario that he leaves the room if Mario enters. Whilst at the academy, Charles achieves Total Worry, and is in charge of all the scheduling (which often keeps him up at night). It is speculated that he and Avril are sexually intimate, and that he is the father of Mario. (Source: http://bit.ly/2H404ZF)")

One of the novel's primary characters, Gately is physically enormous, an avid Alcoholics Anonymous member, and intricately (though not obviously) connected to both the Enfield Tennis Academy and the international struggle to seize the master copy of the Entertainment. During his middle-school and high-school years, Gately's size rendered him a formidable football talent, and he excelled in both offensive and defensive capacities. Gately is known for his toothbrush-in-ass tactic (an outrageous scene that was a favorite at public Wallace readings) and is the accidental murderer of M. DuPlessis, a leader of one of the many separatist Quebecois organizations and a samizdat conspirator. Gately, like Ortho Stice, is visited by the ghost of James O. Incandenza.

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :Hal_Incandenza "is the youngest of the Incandenza children and arguably the protagonist of the novel, the events of which take place largely during his senior year at ETA. Hal is as prodigiously intelligent and talented as the other members of his family, but insecure about his abilities (and eventually his mental state). He has a difficult relationship with both his parents. He reads the Oxford English Dictionary and like his mother often corrects the grammar of his friends and family. Hal's mental degradation and alienation from those around him culminate in his chronologically last appearance in the novel, in which all of his attempts at speech appear to others as uncontrolled screaming. The origin of Hal's final condition is unclear. One possibility is that the mold Hal ingested as a child developed into a hallucinogenic drug known as DMZ, with Hal's marijuana withdrawal serving as a catalyst; alternatively, his friend Michael Pemulis (or another Academy resident) may have doped his toothbrush with that drug. An accidental viewing of the titular film is another possible cause. It is also possible that Hal was subjected to a \"Technical Interview\", as was his older brother Orin.
